== TEMPORARY RAILS 5 SPECIFIC REPO
The main repo is this : https://github.com/adacosta/mongoid_rails_migrations

I needed the latest code in that repo as a gem on https://rubygems.org/ but the author had not been able to update the gem. So I forked the repo and created a duplicate gem on Rubygems here : http://rubygems.org/gems/mongoid_rails_5_migrations

This repo and the duplicate gem will be taken down when the actual gem is updated on Rubygems.

This repo has absolutely no code changes compared to the parent repo from which this is forked.

== RELEASE NOTES
* The most current release, 1.1.x, targets Mongoid >= 4.0.0 and Rails >= 4.2.0 .
* For Rails >= 3.2.0 and Mongoid >= 3.0.0, use version 1.0.0 .
* For Rails >= 3.0.0 (but < 3.2.0) and Mongoid >= 2.0.0, use version 0.0.14 .
